### Android
**What is Android?**

> "Android is a mobile operating system (OS) currently developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android's user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard for text input. In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on notebooks, game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics."

**What Android systems will be used?**

Since a system running Android will be required, App Inventor's default emulator has been chosed as it's easy to use and set up.

### App Inventor
App Inventor is an open-source web application designed to create Android applications through the use of block programming.

Advantages:

- Access to most of the phone's functionality: phone calls, SMS texting, sensors for location, orientation, and acceleration, text-to-speech and speech recognition, sound, video.
- The ability to invoke other apps, with the ActivityStarter component
- Programming control just as with a textual language. There are blocks for conditionals (if, ifelse), foreach, and while, and a fairly comprehensive list of math and logic blocks.
- Database access, both on the device and on the web. So you can save data persistently, and with a web database share data amongst phones.
- Access to web information sources (APIs)-- you can bring in data from Facebook, Amazon, etc. See limitations below.

Disadvantages:

- Limited UIs. The user interface builder has improved but is still a bit buggy and limited, so you can't build any user interface. For instance, you can't create apps with multiple screens and handling orientation changes has some glitches. These problems are not fundamental to the design of App Inventor and will soon be fixed.
- Limited Access to the device. There are not yet components for all the data and functionality of the phone. For instance, you can't save and retrieve files from the file system and you have only limited access to the contact list (e.g., you cannot create groups).
- Limited Access to Web. You can only access APIs that follow a particular protocol (App-Inventor-compatible APIs). So if you want to get data from the web, you'll need to program or have a programmer create an App-Inventor-Compliant API that wraps an existing API. 
- No polymorphic components. Function blocks are tied to specific components, so there is no way to call functions on a generic component. For instance, if you create a procedure MoveXY, it has to be tied to a specific image sprite, not a general image sprite.
- Limited access to the Android Market. The apps (.apk files) generated by App Inventor lack the required configuration for direct inclusion in the market.

To come to a conclusion, it seems that although App Inventor has some limitation, it is fit for the task.

As an experienced programmer, no App Inventor tutorials will need to be followed. My own previous knowledge with various languages and the App Inventor documentation will be enough to carry out the practical investigation efficiently.

## Task 1

### Planning
The task required me to obtain and display a map of a university campus, after looking through the App Inventor documentation, it seemed clear that the canvas component was perfect for the job:

The "BackgroundImage" property can be used to hold the image, and for the future tasks, sprites can be placed in it as buttons.

### Development
To obtain the campus image, I used the search engine "Google" and chose this one:

A canvas was then added to the screen and the campus was set as the background image (through the use of the the "BackgroundImage" property:

## Task 2

### Planning
This task required that each building was touchable and upon being touched the amount of computers available in that building is to be displayed. I thought of many ways to achieve this, but the most reasonable and logic method was to use ImageSprites as buttons.

The reasons for this is because the other option was to use balls, however, when making them invisible they're no longer touchable which was a large disappointment. However, I was able to achieve this by using ImageSrpties and making their image transparent.

I decided to place these buttons in the canvas that was created in the previous task. A label was then placed (outside of the canvas, in screen1) on top of the canvas which is to display the amount of buildings available.
