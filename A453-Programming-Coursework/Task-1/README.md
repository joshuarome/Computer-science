# Task 1: Caesar cipher

Analyse the requirements for this program and design, develop, test and evaluate a program to enter, 
encrypt and decrypt messages.

## 1. Requirements
The Caesar cipher system must:

1. Handle non alphabetical plain/cipher text
2. Handle non integer shift values
3. Handle shifts which go out of bounds
4. Handle upper and lowercase values
5. Take, validate and cipher the users input. Example run:

```bash
Do you want to encode or decode? (E, D)
> E

What is your plain/cipher text?
> COMPUTING IS FUN

What is your shift?
> 5

Your encoded/decoded text is: HTRUZYNSL NX KZS

Do you want to start again? (Y, N)
> N
```
 
## 2. Design
The Caesar cipher has been built assuming that it will be run from a terminal or Pythons IDLE.
The variables and functions have all been documented in `caesar_cipher.py` itself. The doc strings address the requirments listed at the top of this document, in case you do not know how pythonâ€™s doc strings work:

Either look at the source code or import `caesar_cipher.py` as a module and print the `__doc__` property of each function (`cipher`, `get_choice` and `main`).

The Caesar cipher has been designed with two different approaches: pseudocode and a flow chart.

Pseudocode:
```c
Start caesar cipher;

Request cipher choice;
Request plain/cipher text;
Request shift;

while(cipher choice is invalid (E or D)) {
  Display error;
  Request cipher choice;
}

if(choice is D) {
  Make shift negative to decode;
}

For each character in plain/cipher text;
if(character is alphabetical) {
  Display character + shift;
}
 
else {
  Displayer character;
}

End;
```

## 3. Development
Development choices:

When developing this program, Python 3+ was chosen for multiple reasons: When compared to a language like Java, Python programs are generally expected to run slower than Java programs they also take much less time to develop. Python programs are typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java programs. This difference can be attributed to Python's built-in high-level data types and its dynamic typing (source(s) and more information can be found at: https://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons/)

I shan't state all the functions/methods/statements/loops etc. used as most of them are self-explanatory and this is not a python tutorial, but the functions `ord` (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord) and `chr` (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chr) to cipher/decipher the characters, and the loops `for` and `while` were used to iterate and validate.

The inbuilt module `sys` has been used to exit the program with a clean exit status (0) if the program executed without problems, if problems were encountered then the program will exit with a non 0 status - this has been implemented to indicate if the program has ran correctly in the terminal.

Another inbuilt module `argparse` has been used to easily create terminal arguments (as specified in the requirements)

Test plan:

As previously stated the testing of the programs final product must be documented so it has been documented with a validation table.

Validated inputs:
- the users choice to encode or decode:

Input  | Purpose | Result
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Other values than E or D  | Check how the system handles other values than E or D | Output rejected displaying an error message asking to try again
E and D  | Check how the system handles E and D | Output accepted and the program continues to the next logical step

Program test run:
```bash
Do you want to encode or decode? (E, D)
> !

Invalid input, must be in (E, D)

Do you want to encode or decode? (E, D)
> 1.2

Invalid input, must be in (E, D)

Do you want to encode or decode? (E, D)
> a

Invalid input, must be in (E, D)

Do you want to encode or decode? (E, D)
> E
```

- the users cipher shift:

Input  | Purpose | Result
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Non integer values  | Check how the system handles non integer values | Output rejected displaying an error message asking to try again
123456789  | Check how the system handles integer values | Output accepted and the program continues to the next logical step

Program test run:
```bash
What is your shift?
> !

Invalid input, must be an integer

What is your shift?
> 1.2

Invalid input, must be an integer

What is your shift?
> a

Invalid input, must be an integer

What is your shift?
> 1

Your encoded/decoded text is: ...
```

- the users choice to restart or exit:

Input  | Purpose | Result
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Other values than Y or N  | Check how the system handles other values than Y or N | Output rejected displaying an error message asking to try again
Y and N  | Check how the system handles Y and N | Output accepted and the program continues to the next logical step

Program test run:
```bash
Do you want to start again? (Y, N)
> !

Invalid input, must be in (Y, N)


Do you want to start again? (Y, N)
> 1.2

Invalid input, must be in (Y, N)


Do you want to start again? (Y, N)
> a

Invalid input, must be in (Y, N)


Do you want to start again? (Y, N)
> Y

Do you want to encode or decode? (E, D)
> 
```

The terminal arguments are automatically checked and validated by the `argparse` module itself, so creating a test plan for it was not necessary

Development stages:

When developing this program, many development choices were made:
- cipher_text was changed to type list from list to prevent quadratic runtime:
```python
cipher_text = ""
...
cipher_text += letter
...
```
- the main code was placed in a function to avoid the dangers of global variables
- the cipher function used while loops to keep each letter within the alphabet so it was replaced with clever math using modulus to prevent slow running times:
```python
while letter > ord("Z"):
    letter -= 26
    
while letter < ord("A"):
    letter += 26
```
- recursive functions were used for validation which can cause the program to fail so it was replaced with a while loop:
```python
def get_choice(...):
    ...
    get_choice()
    ...
```

Final product:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

    ciphers text by shift and returns the ciphered value
    
    This function encodes or decodes text depending on choice, text is then
    iterated through checking if each character is upper or lower case to
    cipher correctly. Modulos has been used to keep each character in the
    alphabet. The character is only ciphered if the character is alphabetical,
    non alphabetical values will be left the same. The value is then appended
    to cipher_text and is returned as a string

Evaluation:

1. None alphabetical characters are handled on line 46 and 49; each letter is checked to see if they're alphabetical, if they're then thh program progresses onto the next logical step to cipher it. However, if the letter is not alphabetical, then the ciphering process is skipped and it is added to the result unchanged.
2. Non integer shift values are handled at 128 to 134; the program attempts to convert the users input to an int, if it fails then it displays an error (as it must not be an integer value).
3. Letters are kept in the alphabet at line 48; modulus has been used with 26 to keep each letter in the alphabet.
4. Upper/lower case values are handled mainly at line 44; the offset variable keeps the letter into the ASCII values, since capitals and non capital values vary it has made use of a one line if else statement to check if it's upper or not.
5. Input is took, validated and processed in the multiple functions cipher, get_choice and main; the cipher function ciphers certain text by a choice and shift, the get_choice function gets the users input and validates it only accepting certain values and finally the main function is where the main code takes place, it's where the functions are called and input is taken (detailed information of these functions can be found in the functions doc strings).
