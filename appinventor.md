# A452 Practical Investigation Coursework
## Research

To carry out this practical investigation, various pieces of research will need to be carried out.

### Android
**What is Android?**

> "Android is a mobile operating system (OS) currently developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android's user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard for text input. In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on notebooks, game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics."

**What Android systems will be used?**

Since a system running Android will be required, App Inventor's default emulator has been chosed as it's easy to use and set up.

### App Inventor
**What is App Inventor?**

> "App Inventor for Android is an open-source web application originally provided by Google, and now maintained by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

> It allows newcomers to computer programming to create software applications for the Android operating system (OS). It uses a graphical interface, very similar to Scratch and the StarLogo TNG user interface, which allows users to drag-and-drop visual objects to create an application that can run on Android devices. In creating App Inventor, Google drew upon significant prior research in educational computing, as well as work done within Google on online development environments."

**Is App Inventor suitable for the task(s)?**

When researching about App Inventor, it seems to be capable of many functions but has a few limitations:

>Advantages:

> - Access to most of the phone's functionality: phone calls, SMS texting, sensors for location, orientation, and acceleration, text-to-speech and speech recognition, sound, video.
- The ability to invoke other apps, with the ActivityStarter component
- Programming control just as with a textual language. There are blocks for conditionals (if, ifelse), foreach, and while, and a fairly comprehensive list of math and logic blocks.
- Database access, both on the device and on the web. So you can save data persistently, and with a web database share data amongst phones.
- Access to web information sources (APIs)-- you can bring in data from Facebook, Amazon, etc. See limitations below.

> Disadvantages:

> - Limited UIs. The user interface builder has improved but is still a bit buggy and limited, so you can't build any user interface. For instance, you can't create apps with multiple screens and handling orientation changes has some glitches. These problems are not fundamental to the design of App Inventor and will soon be fixed.
- Limited Access to the device. There are not yet components for all the data and functionality of the phone. For instance, you can't save and retrieve files from the file system and you have only limited access to the contact list (e.g., you cannot create groups).
- Limited Access to Web. You can only access APIs that follow a particular protocol (App-Inventor-compatible APIs). So if you want to get data from the web, you'll need to program or have a programmer create an App-Inventor-Compliant API that wraps an existing API. 
- No polymorphic components. Function blocks are tied to specific components, so there is no way to call functions on a generic component. For instance, if you create a procedure MoveXY, it has to be tied to a specific image sprite, not a general image sprite.
- Limited access to the Android Market. The apps (.apk files) generated by App Inventor lack the required configuration for direct inclusion in the market.

To come to a conclusion, it seems that App Inventor is fully capable to achieving the set tasks; it features the core basic functions required for the task as it features:
- images
- sprites
- buttons
- text

In terms of its block programming, it seems that it too is also fully capable to achieving the set tasks; it features the core basic functions required for the task as it features:
- basic variable types (booleans, strings, numbers and lists)
- procedures
- events

Further research of these features can be found in the ```Planning``` stage of each task.

As an experienced programmer who has experience in may other languages (including MSI's own Scratch), App Inventor lessons wont be required. Instead, my past experience, logic and App Inventor documentation (http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/library.html) will be used.

In terms of time, no more than an hour (of the 20 hours given) should be spent on each stage.

## Development
### Planning

This task required that I obtain an image of a University campus and display it on screen. To do this, the search engine "Google" will be used.
